# WT588D
Simple library for using the WT588D soundchip breakout board
The WT588D can play sampled sounds stored in a flash memory on the breakoit board
The WT588D supports various operation modes to trigger playback of sound files
The operartion mode used is also stored in the onboard flash and can only be altered by
flasing the memory.

Currently only the three-line-serial mode is supported in this library

The cuurent veriosn of the library only supports the WT588D-16P breakout board with two times eight PINs
